# Templates
This is the different "templates" that the export is based on.

If you change these you will most likely have to change the corresponding values in the `packages/pokemon.py` script.

### `pokemon.json`
This is the actual pokemon data. It should only contain the bare minimum.

### `pokemon_item.json`
This is the pokemon data for when it is being linked in chat.

### `move.json`
This is the move data.
